    "# Language Translation\n",
    "In this project, I am going to build language translation model called `seq2seq model or encoder-decoder model` in TensorFlow. The objective of the model is translating English sentences to French sentences. I am going to show the detailed steps, and they will answer to the questions like `how to preprocess the dataset`, `how to define inputs`, `how to define encoder model`, `how to define decoder model`, `how to build the entire seq2seq model`, `how to calculate the loss and clip gradients`, and `how to train and get prediction`.\n",

Rather I am going to use the reduced size of the original dataset ([WMT10 French-English corpus](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar)). This version of data is provided by Udacity. If you have GPU machines, feel free to run the codes. There is no other configuration needed."

Luckily, there is the official guide for this [TF Gradient Clipping How?](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/train#Gradient_Clipping).
